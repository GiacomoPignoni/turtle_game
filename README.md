# Turtle Game

This is an app made with Flutter with the idea to replicate the turtle game programming [like this](https://turtleacademy.com/), but with code block
I've mostly done the core part, like an animated canvas to draw and also code block handling. But I lost the inspiration to continue this project, especially for UI
